# callXT


callXT is an android app that sends the subject of the call along with the call and is received at the receiver end as a pop up. It integrates the calling and texting features into one activity. This comes in very handy when the other person has to know the subject of the call and during emergency.It changes the pop up according to the type of the text message sent. We implemented a low level text analysis system to find the context of the call and display the pop up accordingly.
